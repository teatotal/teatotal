# The builder, driven through the widgets it builds: the chips' delete buttons, the
# add rail, the inline editors, the disclosure. The facets here are colour, size,
# weight, shape, note, tag and origin - a chip list with a per-value control, two
# steppers, a single-valued facet, one that takes repeats up to a cap, one revealed
# from the rail, and one only the owner can fill - and, on a second bar, facets
# with operator vocabularies, for the criterion ids, the ops and the fragment.

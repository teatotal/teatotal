# ::streamdoc::StreamDoc - the generic "streaming document of foldable
# regions" base class.
#
# A StreamDoc owns an append-only document rendered into a single read-only
# text widget: chrome (free text between regions) interleaved with REGIONS,
# each a header line, a body, and an optional trailing summary line. The
# host supplies every character through the content door and the hooks
# (Template Method); the base class owns the marks, the two elide layers and
# the streaming contract, and never looks inside a payload.
#
# A region's header is its first line; the body is everything after it.
# A region tracks its position with two real marks:
#   r#Ns  left gravity, at the header line's first char. Left gravity keeps
#         it put when the header is inserted at it.
#   r#Ne  right gravity while the region is open: content emitted at the
#         append point carries it forward on its own. region_close seals it
#         to left gravity; the next region's header, inserted at the same
#         spot, would otherwise drag it along.
# Plus r#Nm at the summary line's first char while one stands. Gravity does
# the bookkeeping; the document streams without index arithmetic.
#
# Two elide layers per region, owned by the base class - no other code
# may mutate a tag's -elide:
#   f#N  the fold range [header +1line linestart, end): whole logical lines
#        only, never the header's own newline - eliding it would visually
#        join adjacent headers when everything is folded.
#   d#N  the region's detail content (lines the host tags with detail_tag),
#        hidden by default. Configured after f#N, which gives it the higher
#        tag priority: where both cover a char, the detail elide wins, and
#        unfolding a region does not spill its hidden detail. fold forces
#        d#N back to hidden, the same rule from the other side. No host tag
#        laid over a region may set an explicit -elide of its own, or it
#        would override the fold; tags that leave -elide unset never do.
#
# Content enters through the door, inside `batch`: append_open / emit /
# emit_window / append_close. While a region is open the door feeds it,
# popping any standing summary line first and re-appending it at close
# (the summary transaction, internal to the base class); between regions
# the door appends chrome at the tail. `savepoint` takes a left-gravity mark at the append
# point and `rewind mark` deletes from it to the open region's end, so a
# caller can re-emit a provisional tail; the summary pop is built on it.
#
# Glyphs: the first char of a header line and of a summary line is a state
# glyph from the -glyphs pair. fold/unfold and detail_show/hide swap it with
# a same-length replace, so every index downstream stays true. A first char
# that is not one of the pair is left alone; glyphless headers work.
#
# Anti-self-scroll: `batch` brackets a streamed mutation with anchor_save /
# anchor_restore, so content landing below a parked reader never moves the
# line they are on. With -autofollow on and the reader at the tail, the view
# latches there and follows appends (the tail -f contract), released the
# moment they scroll away; <<AtBottom>> / <<LeftBottom>> fire on the host
# frame at the edges, and `follow` jumps back to the tail.
#
# Find (Ctrl-F): a bar under the text whose entry collects every literal
# hit, folded and hidden text included, tags it `find`, and steps through
# the hits with wraparound, each one through `reveal`. The base class lays
# the tag and owns no ink; the host configures `find` for the look.
#
# Hooks the host overrides, each with a working default:
#   summary_text payload    the summary phrase; "" takes no summary line
#   region_tags payload     tags laid on the summary line the base class writes
#   on_region_rendered n    wire a just-closed region (bindings, indices)
#   on_reveal idx           runs first in reveal, before anything scrolls
#   place_find frame        where the find bar sits; default the row below
#   find_chrome_tags        tags whose text find skips; default `summary`
#   find_bound              where the text search stops; default `end`
#   find_extra term nocase  {index excerpt} hits the text search cannot see
#   find_excerpt idx        the excerpt a hit shows
#   on_find_collected / on_find_stepped i / find_cleared

    # is well-formed, starts on a line start, and the regions are ordered and
    # disjoint down the buffer; a standing summary mark sits inside its region;
    # the open region's end rides the buffer tail. A violation means a mark
    # desynced - the class of fault behind a fold that swallows its neighbour.
    # Gated on the STREAMDOC_AUDIT env var so production pays nothing; when on,
    # it logs the first violation with the call chain and latches off, naming
    # the primitive that broke the contract. Every primitive calls this at its

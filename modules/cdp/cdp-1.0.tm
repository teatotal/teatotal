# cdp - a Chrome DevTools Protocol client over plain RFC6455 websockets.
#
# A script drives a browser over flat CDP JSON. The transport URL is any
# DevTools websocket endpoint: a page target read off http://127.0.0.1:PORT/json
# after launching Chromium with --remote-debugging-port, or a loopback proxy
# that forwards CDP frames and preserves the client's top-level integer id.
# Both are plain RFC6455 with no Authorization header, so one client serves
# both. A script may also leave the URL to the CDP_WS_URL environment
# variable and call cdp::connect with no argument.
#
# Framing is minimal RFC6455: FIN=1 opcode=1 masked text frames out,
# id-matched responses in with interleaved CDP events skipped. tcllib json
# handles encode/decode.
#
# API:
#   set cdp [cdp::connect]              ;# reads CDP_WS_URL; or cdp::connect $url
#   $cdp cdp <method> ?paramsDict?      ;# send a command, return matched response dict
#   $cdp navigate <url>                 ;# Page.enable + Page.navigate
#   $cdp evaluate <jsExpr>             ;# Runtime.evaluate value (returnByValue, awaitPromise)
#   $cdp close
#
# Network-interception API (for callers that read the page's own network
# traffic rather than replaying requests, e.g. when request signatures rotate):
#   $cdp cdpBuffered <method> ?paramsDict?  ;# like cdp, but parks any CDP events
#                                            # seen while awaiting the response
#   $cdp drainEvents <seconds>          ;# park every event seen for <seconds>
#   $cdp events                          ;# the parked events (list of dicts)
#   $cdp clearEvents                     ;# empty the event buffer
